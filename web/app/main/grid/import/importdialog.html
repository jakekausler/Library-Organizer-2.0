    <h1 class="md-title">Import Books</h1>
    <p>
        Please upload a csv file with the books you would like to import. Note that the csv should contain column names exactly as they would be used in a mysql query, with three exceptions. First, do not supply the fields BookID or PublisherID. Second, include four columns to make up for PublisherID: Publisher, City, State, and Country. Finally, include a column named Contributors which contains the contributors for each book. Each contributor should be formatted as "last, first middle[ middle_1... middle_N]:role". Separate contributors with a semicolon. The image url should be a web location from which to download the book image. All numeric values should be in the correct format. Each cell must contain a title.
